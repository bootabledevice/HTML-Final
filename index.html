                So first off I wanna to say thank you, Mrs. Waller. This class has been a great learning experience. So like everyone else I started with a template, it was only one page with six icons, a nav bar, and some text. All the only pages I had to make myself, I also made all the icons and the background (The background is only a light gradient so nothing special) myself in photoshop. I made the icons in Photoshop because I couldn't find icons that matched and that I liked. I have spent many hours on this site breaking it and fixing it. It might not look the best but I am very happy with how it came out. When I started I had so many problems with div containers and making them align the way I wanted. After a few hours of trying and breaking things, I finally got it. Making the images a link was another problem I ran into, that one was fixed quickly with the help of google. All the content for HTML Essential Training, Bootstrap 3 Essential Training, and Web Technology Fundamentals are not from my notes. I went back through the Lynda.com videos and made new notes for them. WordPress Ecommerce is the only page that uses my notes on Google Docs.
