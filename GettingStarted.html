        Bootstrap is a framework that helps you create websites quickly with tons of features that would be hard or take a long time for you to create yourself. Now Bootstrap has a mobile-first approach which means that a website that you create with Bootstrap is mobile friendly. Instead of having to create your own mobile styles, the framework assumes that you want to create a mobile friendly site and has the styles to support them. Bootstrap comes with a fluid twelve-column responsive system that scales and adjusts according to the size of the device. It has predefined classes that make layout super easy. Now using Bootstrap will save you a lot of time since it has been tested in thousands of sites and on many devices. Of course, Bootstrap uses CSS, JavaScript, and HTML and is also available in less and sass versions. It's also fully customizable so you can only what you need. Using a framework means that you're going to need to write your code in a very specific way. That means that you don't just write with whatever classes or structure you want to follow, but learn how to write the way that the framework wants you to write code.

        <p><h3>CDNs And Manual Installs</h3>
            The easiest way to install Bootstrap is to use the CDN code. Now, this is a great option if you're going to be using the standard Bootstrap version because it will be faster for most of your users. A CDN is a Content Delivery Network, which means a place that hosts common libraries like Bootstrap. However there are times when you'll want to work with the framework without a live connection to the internet or perhaps you want to customize it just a bit. So to do that you'll need to install things manually.

        &lt;script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-Tc5IQib027qvyjSMfHjOMaLkfuWVxZxUPnCJA7l2mCWNIpG9mGCD8wGNIcPD7Txa" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
