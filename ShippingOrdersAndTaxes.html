        A big decision when selling physical goods is how to calculate shipping costs. One of the most basic shipping options is Flat Rate shipping. Free shipping is something that many eCommerce platforms have. The next type of shipping option that store owners want are estimates. Instead of guessing how much shipping will cost you,and passing those costs along to the customer, you can get rates directly from a shipping provider, like USPS, FedEx or UPS. When you sell on a marketplace like Amazon, they aren't really your customers.  If you aren't on Amazon, you're missing out on a massive audience. Some countries have a federal tax you pay, some states have a tax on top of that, some counties have a tax on top of that, and some cities have a tax on top of that. If you have Nexus in a place, you have to pay those taxes. (like a warehouse or storefront.) Different countries in Europe have different tax rates and you have to track each one and apply it automatically.
